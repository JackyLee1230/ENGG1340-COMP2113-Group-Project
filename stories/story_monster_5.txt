The Wraith went through a dimensional portal before I could give the final blow.
Nothing was left behind from the portal, except a revolving sound of wind.

It was bizarre that these monsters kept dropping weapons which, 
obliviously, did not belong to them.

Maybe they were left by the dead monster slayers and treasure hunters.

These weapons seemed to be enchanted with an unknown cast, with power never seen.
Maybe they would prove handy for defeating any monster.

“I can sense that an untouchable, gigantic monster was approaching me…”
