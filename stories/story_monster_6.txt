After defeating the Inferno, it screamed with unbearable volume,
triggering all of the surrounding monsters, shaking the ground.
The unrivalled scream alarmed other monsters to escape from the castle,
run into the forest nearby and disappear.

The Inferno flew into the sky after being defeated.
It surrouned itself with a flaming ring and bursted into dust of flames.
The fog around the castle slowly faded, but the mystery remains unsolved.
