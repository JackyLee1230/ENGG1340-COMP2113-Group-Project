After defeating the Inferno, it scremed with unbearable volume,
triggering all of the surrounding monsters, shaking the ground.
The alarming scream alarmed other monsters to escape from the castle,
ran into the forest nearby and disappeared.

The Inferno flew into the sky after being defeated.
It surrouned itself with a flaming ring and bursted into dust of flames.
The fog around the castle slowly faded, but the mystery remains unsolved.
