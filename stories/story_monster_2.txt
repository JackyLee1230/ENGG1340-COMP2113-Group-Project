Storing thousands of books, the library recorded the history of the great family and
a myraid of interest of the owner of the castle.

Yet, recent books were scribbled with unreadable words.

"Perphaps some of them were humans before, who squeezed their last wisdom to
record what was happening in the castle before losing them...", I wondered.

Carrying this thought of mind, I decided to continue my journey instead of being
caught up in the thoughts to finish my goal.
